Nicole is a software engineer at Microsoft, working on the vcpkg package manager for C++. She graduated from Western Washington University in 2019 with a degree in mathematics, and was hired out of school by Microsoft to work on vcpkg. Since then, she both designed and implemented two of vcpkg's major new features: manifests, and registries. She has been involved extensively with Rust in the past, and is a founding member and moderator for the [#include<C++>](includecpp.org) community.
