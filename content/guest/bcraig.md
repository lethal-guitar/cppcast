Ben Craig is a Vice Chair of C++ Library Evolution in WG21.  This involves prioritizing papers, running meetings, and giving the Library Evolution chair as much grief as possible.

Ben is a Chief Software Engineer at NI, primarily developing device drivers for various operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac, OpenRTOS, vxWorks, ETS Pharlap).  He occasionally tinkers on the build tooling and firmware side of things.
